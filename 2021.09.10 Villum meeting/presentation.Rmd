# Research questions of interest

Time until a certain event of interest takes place

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the probability that the event does (not) take place in the next X years?
\item Are there differences in event timing between groups?
\item How do certain personal, behavioral or other characteristics affect when the event takes place in an individuals' life?
\end{itemize}

# Time-to-event analysis: basic quantities 

- $T$ = time of the event, random variable with density function $f(t)$
- $C$ = censoring time
- Survival = probability of surviving up to time $t$, a "risk":\newline
$S(t) = P(T > t)$
- Hazard = instantaneous probability of event at time $t$ given one has not experienced the event before, a "rate":\newline $\lambda(t) = P(T \in (t, t+ \Delta t) \mid T \leq t)$
- Hazard has a direct relation to the survival: $\lambda(t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$


# Time-to-event analysis: the proportional hazards model

$$\lambda_i(t) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(\boldsymbol{s}_i(t)'\boldsymbol{\gamma})$$

- $\lambda_i(t) =$ hazard at time $t$ for individual $i$
- $\lambda_0(t) =$ baseline hazard at time $t$
- $\boldsymbol{s}_i(t) =$ vector of covariates at time $t$ for individual $i$
- $\boldsymbol{\gamma} =$ vector of coefficients

$\exp(\boldsymbol{\gamma})$, interpretation as a relative risk \newline

Can be written as a poisson model for (piecewise constant) hazard rates. Convenient for ML methods (see e.g. @Bender2020-ft).

# Modelling issues/challenges

1. Censoring
    - Hazard can be computed for right censored data (uses individuals at risk).
    - Maybe less of a problem in register data, but immigration/emigration.
    - Under right censoring, using a logistic regression model results in biased estimates.
    - Dependent, left, interval censoring
2. Competing risks
    - An event that either hinders the observation of the event of interest or modifies the chance that the event occurs.
    - Dying twice.
    - No one-to-one relation between hazard and survival of a single event (@Andersen2012-wv).


# Modelling issues/challenges (cont.)
3. Recurrent events
    - Repeated observations of the same event, e.g. doctor visits, birth of children, change of job
4. Time varying covariates
5. Time varying effects ($\boldsymbol{\gamma}_t$)
6. Endogeneity of covariates
    - Bias if association between covariate and event is bidirectional.
    - Solution: joint models (economics: simultaneous equations, simulatneous hazard), with multiple outcomes (time-to-event and longitudinal)
7. Causality
8. Including lots and lots of covariates and (non-linear) associations for many individuals over a long time period

# Time-to-event analysis: basic quantities (with equations)

- $T$ time of the event, r.v. with density function $f(t)$
- $C$ censoring time
- Probability that event has occured by time $t$, c.d.f.:\newline
$P(T\leq t) =\int_0^t f(t)dt$
- Survival = probability of surviving up to time $t$:\newline
$S (t) = P(T > t) = 1 - F(t) = \int_t^{\infty} f(t)dt = \exp(-\int_0^t \lambda(t) dt)$
- Hazard = instantaneous probability of event at time $t$ given one has not experienced the event before: \newline $\lambda(t) = P(T \in (t, t+ \Delta t) \mid T \leq t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)} = -\frac{d}{dt} \log S(t)$
- Cumulative hazard, $\Lambda(t) = \int_0^t\lambda(t)dt$
